 * When Photos runs inside the Mind shell, the shell hands its color mode over
 * the capability bridge (`mind:welcome { theme }`). This component applies that
 * theme to Photos' own ThemeProvider so the embedded chrome matches the shell
 * instead of falling back to Photos' `dark` default — and tracks live shell
 * theme toggles (the shell re-broadcasts welcome on change).
 *
 * Standalone, no theme is ever brokered, so this is a no-op and Photos keeps
 * its own theme (default + user toggle). Renders nothing.
